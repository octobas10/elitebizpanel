New York (without regard to conflict of law principles). Should a dispute arise concerning the terms and conditions of the Agreement, or the breach of same by any party hereto, the parties agree to submit their dispute for resolution by arbitration before the American Arbitration Association in
NY, New York, in accordance with the then current Commercial Arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. Any award rendered shall be final and conclusive to the parties and a judgment thereon may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing herein shall be construed to preclude any party from seeking injunctive relief in order to protect its rights pending arbitration.

You agree to pay the attorney's fees and court costs that elitehomeimprovers incurs in seeking such relief. The Agreement does not constitute a waiver of any of your rights and remedies to pursue a claim individually and not as a class action in binding arbitration as provided above. This provision preventing you from bringing, joining or participating in class action lawsuits is an independent agreement. Should any part of the Agreement be held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed consistent with applicable law and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect.<br>

Our failure to enforce any provision of the Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision nor of the right to enforce such provision.
